# EvilnoVNC
**EvilnoVNC** is a Ready to go Phishing Platform. 

Unlike other phishing techniques, EvilnoVNC allows 2FA bypassing by using a real browser over a noVNC connection.

In addition, this tool allows us to see in real time all of the victim's actions, access to their downloaded files and the entire browser profile, including cookies, saved passwords, browsing history and much more.

# Requirements
- Docker


# Installation

It's recommended to clone the complete repository or download the zip file.
Additionally, it's necessary to build Docker manually. You can do this by running the following commands:

## Auto

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wanetty/MultiEvilnoVNC.git
cd EvilnoVNC
make build
```
## Manual

```
git clone https://github.com/wanetty/MultiEvilnoVNC.git
cd EvilnoVNC ; sudo chown -R 103 Downloads
sudo docker build -f evilnovnc.Dockerfile -t evilnovnc .
sudo docker build -f nginx.Dockerfile -t evilnginx .
```

## Cleanup

If you want to remove the automatically built docker images on your system simply run the following commands.

```bash
make clean
```

# Usage MultiServer

```bash
./start_auto.sh $url [--no-ddos-protection]
```

If you want to make it more credible, modify the index.html by adapting the js code.

You will find the cookies and the keylogger output inside the Downloads folder in its corresponding id.

# Last Update (Not More DoS)

In this latest version a system has been added so that in the event that users start to enter in an uncontrolled manner, the system does not break, as before they started to create containers infinitely and this could bring down the server, with the new system that has been created, now the maximum possible containers will be created so that they work with maximum performance. 

You can always set it back to the way it worked before, i.e. without restrictions, using the `--no-ddos-protection' flag.

## Disclaimer

**Warning:** This tool has not been fully tested in Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments, such as those provided by platforms like AWS with pre-installed Kali Linux. Initial testing has revealed functionality issues in these environments.

We recommend using a distribution such as **Ubuntu** for optimal performance. We are conducting further tests to improve compatibility with more environments. Stay tuned for future updates.
